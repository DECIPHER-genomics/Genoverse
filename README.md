Genoverse is a portable, customizable, back-end independent JavaScript and HTML5 based genome browser which allows the user to explore data in a dynamic and interactive manner.

Data is visualized in the browser, meaning Genoverse can be installed on any website and show data from a wide range of online or local sources.

Genoverse works with a variety of formats, such as XML, JSON, BED, VCF, GFF, GFF3 or delimited text files, and can be customized to parse and display any data source as required.
